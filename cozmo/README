Benzo is a blabberbot written in python.  His means of generating text is a 
Markov Chain- an algorithm that takes english text as input, and generates 
output (when addressed) based on statistics gathered from the input text.
At least thats what its used for here.

Here's where I got the basic implementation:

All I've done is add persistence and slap a silly IRC bot on the top of it. 

Follow the directions in INSTALL to set up the bot for the first time. 

A few notes and caveats regarding pre 1.0 versions:

1) The implementation of persistence is quite sloppy- the entire brain is 
   loaded into memory on startup and flushed to disk at set intervals - 
   which amounts to an eventuallly large memory footprint and a sizeable CPU 
   hit as the brain is deserialized/serialized.  Future versions will be 
   DBM/SQL based, and not have this limitation.

2) The module interface is not cleanly defined yet- so expect cusomizations 
   made now to break in future versions.

3) Ditto for the config file.

4) Ditto for the User DB.

If all that hasn't discouraged you, set the bot loose on your favorite IRC
channel.  Let him sit and learn for awhile before announcing his presence, 
or else he'll just repeat stuff.
