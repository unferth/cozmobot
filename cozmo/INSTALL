Quick and Dirty install instructions:

1)  Make a brain for your bot by running makebrain.py
2)  Edit Config.py and set variables accordingly
3)  Run benzo.py to start the bot
4)  When the bot joins IRC, message it immediately as follows:

/msg <botname> hello

The bot should respond, indicating that it has recognized you as its owner. 
From this point on, you will have access to the bots commands (which are
few at this point).

All commands are issued as follows:

/msg <botname> password command arguments

where 'password' is the password you entered in Config.py

COMMANDS
--------
die : sign off and exit cleanly.  
adduser <nick> <flags> <userhost> : 'o' is op, 'm' master, 'f' friend, 'e' enemy
opme channel: get ops from the bot

thats it! sucks, doesnt it?
